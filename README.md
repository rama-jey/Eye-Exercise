# Eye-Exercise

# Description:
This eye exercise makes the eyeball to look at the cursor wherever we move the mouse on the screen. The styles.css file contains the position of the eyes and the balls with the background color. The <div> for one eye-ball is copied to create the next eye and that created two eyes.

# How to Run:
Download and run the html file in your Chrome browser(recommended). You will see a pair of eyes on your screen. Try moving your cursor on the screen with mouse. You can notice the eye balls are watching your cursor wherever it moves.  

# Roadmap of future improvements:
If I click anywhere on the screen, to make the eyeballs pause wherever my cursor is at that time. On the next mouse click it can continue following the cursor.
